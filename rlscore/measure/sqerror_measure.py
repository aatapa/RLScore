    A performance measure for regression problems. Computes the sum of (Y[i]-P[i])**2

    If 2-dimensional arrays are supplied as arguments, then error is separately computed for
    each column, after which the errors are averaged.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    Y : {array-like}, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_tasks]
        Correct utility values, can be any real numbers
    P : {array-like}, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_tasks]
        Predicted utility values, can be any real numbers.
