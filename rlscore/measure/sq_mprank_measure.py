def sqmprank(Y, P):
    """Squared magnitude preserving ranking error.
    
    A performance measure for ranking problems. Computes the sum of (Y[i]-Y[j]-P[i]+P[j])**2
    over all index pairs. normalized by the number of pairs. For query-structured data,
    one would typically want to compute the error separately for each query, and average.
    
    If 2-dimensional arrays are supplied as arguments, then error is separately computed for
    each column, after which the errors are averaged.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    Y : {array-like}, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_labels]
        Correct utility values, can be any real numbers
    P : {array-like}, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_labels]
        Predicted utility values, can be any real numbers.
