    """Binary classification accuracy.
    
    A performance measure for binary classification problems.
    Returns the fraction of correct class predictions. P[i]>0 is
    considered a positive class prediction and P[i]<0 negative.
    P[i]==0 is considered as classifier abstaining to make a decision,
    which incurs 0.5 errors (in contrast to 0 error for correct and 1
    error for incorrect prediction).
    
    If 2-dimensional arrays are supplied as arguments, then accuracy
    is separately computed for each column, after which the accuracies
    are averaged.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    Y : {array-like}, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_labels]
        Correct labels, must belong to set {-1,1}
    P : {array-like}, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_labels]
        Predicted labels, can be any real numbers. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    accuracy : float
        number between 0 and 1
